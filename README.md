Final Project - Computational Mathematics Variant 4 Instructions
Implement the assigned tasks, ensuring that they include: 
- Source code with comments explaining all important steps. 
- Screenshots of program outputs and explanations. 
- Graphs or tables where applicable. 
- Detailed explanations for your approaches and results. 

For the final project you will be required to develop an integrated interface that allows for user interaction with various computational tasks. The interface should enable users:
- to change methods dynamically (e.g., droplist or radio buttons with all the methods within your variant)
- to input coefficients for equations
- enter values into matrices
- provide intervals, initial guesses/approximations, and etc.
- specify integrals
- enter subinterval values
- manipulate arrays (data)
- add additional parameters depending on the method (e.g., omega, accuracy value, and etc.).

<b>Additionally, it should provide buttons for:</b>
- executing calculations
- plotting graphs/tables if it's applicable.

And a designated area for displaying results. 

Save your work as a PDF report and submit it to Moodle before the deadline. P.S. Please be prepared to explain your code/solution/answers.

Task 1: Graphical Method and Absolute Error
Problem: Plot the graph of f(x)=cos⁡(x)−x in the range x∈[0,1]. Use the graph to find an approximate root and calculate the absolute error compared to the root found using a numerical method.

Task 2: Comparison of Root-Finding Methods
Problem: Find the root of f(x)=x2−4sin⁡(x) in the interval [0,3] using:
- False position methods.
- Newton-Raphson methods.
- Measure iterations and calculate relative errors for both methods.

- Task 3: Jacobi Method
Problem: Solve the system of equations: 3x+y−z=1 2x−8y+z=−2 −x+y+5z=3 Start with an initial guess x0=[0,0,0]x0 =[0,0,0].

- Task 4: Iterative Method for Matrix Inversion
Problem: Compute the inverse of matrix using an iterative method with an initial guess based on its trace. 

Task 5: Linear Curve Fitting
Problem: Fit a line to data points: (1,5),(2,8),(3,12),(4,15),(5,20) using least squares.

Task 6: First Derivative Using Newton’s Forward Difference Formula
Problem: Given data points x=[0,1,2] and y=[1,3,7], estimate dy/dx at x=1.

Task 7: Taylor Series Method
Problem: Using the Taylor series method, solve dy/dx=y2+x2, y(0)=1, to compute y(0.1) and y(0.2). Use up to the third derivative for approximation.

Task 8: Simpson’s 3/8 Rule
Problem: Using Simpson’s 3/8 Rule, compute ∫52x3 dx with 6 subintervals. Provide the absolute error compared to the exact value.
